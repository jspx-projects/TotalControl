# Agent guidance

Read this file before starting work in this repository.

## Required reading before changes

Before changing code, tests, tooling or documentation, read the documents
that own the affected behaviour. The minimum set is:

- this file;
- `docs/TOTALCONTROL-ARCHITECTURE.md` for runtime layers and data flow;
- `docs/spec/TOTALCONTROL-STATE-SPEC.md` for persistence, workspaces and host
  settings;
- `docs/spec/TOTALCONTROL-GUI-SPEC.md` for visible behaviour;
- the device protocol specification, template specification, OSC
  specification or development note that owns the area being changed.

Do not infer the intended behaviour from the code alone. If the owning
document is unclear or missing, update it in the same change. A change that
alters user-visible behaviour or a persisted format is incomplete until its
specification and `docs/TOTALCONTROL-Manual.md` counterpart are updated.

## Documentation rules

`docs/spec/` contains authoritative specifications. Write them as reference
documents for the current implementation, not as a work log.

- State **what something is** and how it behaves. Do not describe what it is
  not, what it used to be, or what went wrong before.
- No historical notes, retractions, changelogs, capture diaries, or "oracle
  said" narration in a specification.
- No personal identifying information anywhere in the repository, pull
  requests, commit messages or issues. Do not put serial numbers, USB
  vendor/product IDs, hostnames, usernames, file paths with a home directory,
  or device addresses there. Use placeholders such as `<checkout>` instead of
  a contributor's local path.
- Do not commit captured device state: raw state dumps, mixer scenes, capture
  files or the values of a user's current setup. Keep captures outside the
  repository and use synthetic fixtures for tests.
- Keep specifications minimal. Tables and short normative paragraphs are
  preferred over prose.
- Put open questions, TODO lists, capture requests and working notes in
  `docs/work/`. They are not part of the specification.
- The specification describes the shipped model and its device writes. When
  evidence is incomplete, state the implemented mapping positively and keep
  the open question in `docs/work/`.
- Base UI figures on current TotalMix FX screenshots; the vendor manual can
  lag the shipping application.
- The end-user documentation is `docs/TOTALCONTROL-Manual.md`. The specifications
  are for developers; user-facing behaviour described in them must have a
  counterpart in the manual, and how-to material belongs in the manual, not
  in a specification.

Authoritative files:

- `docs/TOTALCONTROL-ARCHITECTURE.md` — runtime layers, device service, data
  flow, state ownership, driver and latency model.
- `docs/spec/TOTALCONTROL-GUI-SPEC.md` — visible UI, panels, gestures and
  visible state.
- `docs/spec/TOTALCONTROL-STATE-SPEC.md` — state ownership, current
  workspace, autosave, restore, host settings and layout files.
- `docs/spec/TOTALCONTROL-OSC-SPEC.md` — OSC 1.96 and Global OSC transport,
  address spaces, scales, feedback and mapping.
- `docs/spec/FIREFFACE-UCX-PROTOCOL-SPEC.md` — UCX transport, registers,
  controls and metering.
- `docs/spec/FIREFFACE-UC-PROTOCOL-SPEC.md` — UC protocol and controls.
- `docs/spec/BABYFACE-PRO-PROTOCOL-SPEC.md` — Babyface Pro FS channel model,
  ALSA surface, vendor USB protocol, DSP EQ blocks and metering.
- `docs/spec/BABYFACE-CLASSIC-PROTOCOL-SPEC.md` — Babyface-classic transport,
  channel model, mixer writes, preamps, metering and hwdep ABI.
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT-TOOLS.md` — development-only backends and tools.

## UI rules

All UI layout and interaction rules live in `docs/spec/TOTALCONTROL-GUI-SPEC.md`.
Do not duplicate them here; when a rule is missing, add it to the spec.

## Git workflow

`main` is the protected integration branch. Every change lands through a pull
request; do not commit or push directly to `main`.

- Start from current `main`: `git switch main && git pull --ff-only`, then
  create a short-lived branch.
- Use one branch and one PR per logical change. Branch prefixes are `fix/`,
  `feat/`, `perf/`, `docs/`, `test/` and `chore/`.
- Keep commits atomic. Explain why the change is needed in the commit message
  and in the PR description, using `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
- Push the branch, open a draft PR early, and wait for CI. Do not merge with a
  failing or missing required check.
- Do not merge or close a pull request until the user has explicitly approved
  the completed change. Keep it open or draft while work continues; merge or
  close only when the user specifically asks for that action.
- Use squash merge by default so `main` stays linear and each PR has one
  revert point. Use rebase-and-merge only for a deliberately clean commit
  series; do not add merge commits.
- After merging, delete the branch, fast-forward local `main`, and run
  `git fetch --prune`.
- Rebase a feature branch on `origin/main` when needed and push it with
  `--force-with-lease`. Never force-push `main`.
- Do not mix unrelated driver, UI, documentation and tooling changes in one
  PR unless they are required for the same tested behaviour.
- Hardware and driver PRs record the device model, transport, firmware,
  quantum, test evidence, and confirmation that the user scene and
  `~/.config/totalcontrol/gui.json` were preserved.

## Working rules

- Use the NAS coordination mailbox for Windows/oracle questions and
  acknowledgements. Linux owns `LINUX-STATUS.md`, `LINUX-REQUESTS.md`,
  `DECISIONS.md`, `analysis/*` and `coordination/inbox/windows/*`.
- Push only to our own repository, `jspx-projects/TotalControl`.
- Open or update pull requests only in our own repository,
  `jspx-projects/TotalControl`. Never open, update, or comment on a pull
  request in any other repository without explicit permission for that
  specific action each time.
- The UI is part of this repository. Do not add an external TotalControl development
  remote; the imported upstream history is on `archive/tuxmix-upstream`.
- Preserve the user scene and `~/.config/totalcontrol/gui.json`. Leave the device on
  the user's scene after hardware tests.
- One Fireface at a time.
- Verify with `cargo test -p totalcontrol-core --lib --features alsa` and
  `cargo test -p totalcontrol-gui`.
- Do not replace device-backed behaviour with host-side approximations. If the
  unit supports something and the register is unknown, add it to
  `docs/work/` and request a capture.
