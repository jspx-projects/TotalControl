# OSC 1.96 and Global OSC control specification

This document defines the two OSC surfaces used to drive TotalMix FX and the
mapping from those surfaces to the Fireface UCX register protocol.  OSC 1.96
is the banked classic surface defined by RME's `OscTableTotalMix_240722`,
dated 2024-07-24.  Global OSC is the absolute-channel surface defined by RME's
Global OSC table for TotalMix FX 2.1 and later.

| Dialect | Reference | Status |
|---|---|---|
| OSC 1.96 | `OscTableTotalMix_240722` | supported |
| OSC 1.90 | older classic table | not supported |
| Global OSC | RME Global OSC table (TotalMix FX 2.1+) | separate dialect |

Global OSC is specified in [§13](#13-global-osc) and implemented by
`totalcontrol-gui/src/osc_global.rs`.  TotalMix FX 2.10 and 2.11 compatibility
is not a support target; they are only useful as compatibility evidence for
the 1.96 table.

The document covers protocol behaviour only. Enabling OSC in TotalMix FX and
configuring the network are operational steps and live outside this
specification.

## 1. Transport

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Protocol | OSC 1.0 |
| Transport | UDP |
| Encoding | big-endian |
| Values | 32-bit float, 32-bit integer, string |
| Control direction | controller to TotalMix FX |
| Feedback direction | TotalMix FX to controller |
| Fixed ports | none; both directions are configurable |
| Query request | none |
| Feedback source port | selected by the operating system |

A message is a single OSC message or an OSC bundle. Bundles contain
length-prefixed messages and may be nested.

TotalMix FX sends feedback only when state changes or when a page is selected.
A command that changes no state may produce no reply. The controller reads
state from feedback; it does not poll.

## 2. Message form

```text
/path/name ,types values
```

The type tag string is required. Control values are normally a single float:

```text
/1/micgain1 ,f 0.8
```

Display values are separate messages with a `Val` suffix:

```text
/1/micgain1Val ,s "52.0 dB"
```

A page prefix selects a control page. Sending any parameter with a page prefix
that differs from the current page makes TotalMix FX re-send the complete state
of that page.

## 3. Address model

```text
/page/control
/page/control/index
/control
```

| Prefix | Page | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/1` | Mixer | Banked fader grid: inputs, software playback and hardware outputs |
| `/2` | Channel | Settings for the selected single channel |
| `/3` | FX and groups | Reverb, Echo, snapshots, mute/solo/fader groups and recorder |
| `/4` | Room EQ | Output bus Room EQ |
| `/` | None | Navigation and workspace commands |

Page 1 is a bank of faders. The UCX exposes 18 hardware inputs, 18 software
playback channels and 18 hardware outputs. Channel numbering is zero-based;
a stereo pair is addressed by its left channel.

Page 2 addresses one channel selected by `setBankStart`, `setOffsetInBank` or
page-1 navigation. The page-2 paths carry no channel index.

`setSubmix` selects the hardware output whose submix is edited. Page-1 faders
and pans are sends into that submix. Output faders are the submix masters.

## 4. Navigation

These paths have no page prefix.

| Path | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `/setSubmix` | `0 … submix_count-1` | Selects the hardware output submix |
| `/setBankStart` | `0 … channel_count-1` | Selects a page-2 channel; on page 1 sets the first channel of the bank |
| `/setOffsetInBank` | `0 … bank_size-1` | Selects the page-2 channel relative to the page-1 bank start |
| `/loadQuickWorkspace` | `1 … 30` | Loads a configured Quick Workspace |

A stereo channel is selected by its left channel number. Only valid,
remote-enabled channels are accepted.

Page 1 and page 2 also have relative navigation:

| Path | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/1/track+` | Move bank start one channel forward |
| `/1/track-` | Move bank start one channel back |
| `/1/bank+` | Move bank start one bank forward |
| `/1/bank-` | Move bank start one bank back |
| `/2/track+` | Select the next channel |
| `/2/track-` | Select the previous channel |

## 5. Value scales

| Scale | Receive | Feedback |
|---|---|---|
| `Lin01` | linear 0.0 … 1.0 | linear 0.0 … 1.0 |
| `Fader` | fader curve 0.0 … 1.0 | fader curve 0.0 … 1.0 |
| `Freq` | pseudo-logarithmic 0.0 … 1.0 | pseudo-logarithmic 0.0 … 1.0 |
| `OnOff` | 0.0 or 1.0 | 0.0 or 1.0 |
| `Toggle` | 1.0 toggles; 0.0 is ignored | resulting 0.0 or 1.0 |
| `Direct` | 1:1 value | 1:1 value |
| `Level` | meter value | meter value |
| `String` | text | text |

`Toggle` is edge-triggered. One `1.0` changes the state; a second `1.0`
changes it back. `0.0` does not set the state to off.

`Lin01` values map to the destination's full range. Type selections use
evenly spaced values; an EQ type with two choices uses `0.0` and `1.0`.

The fader curve maps a normalized position `p` to dB:

```text
f = p * 1023
if f >= 649:
    db = f * 0.0320855615 - 26.8235294118
else:
    db = -(f * f) / 11033 + f * 0.1497326203 - 65
```

The inverse curve is used for feedback:

```text
if db >= -6:
    p = ((db + 26.8235294118) / 0.0320855615) / 1023
else:
    p = (826 - sqrt(-34869 - 11033 * db)) / 1023
```

The frequency curve is:

```text
p = (ln(hz) - ln(20)) / (ln(20000) - ln(20))
hz = exp(p * (ln(20000) - ln(20)) + ln(20))
```

Display companions use these suffixes:

| Suffix | Contents |
|---|---|
| `Val` | numeric value, selection name or dB string |
| none | raw normalized value |

## 6. Page 1 — mixer

Page 1 is the banked mixer. Faders, pans, mutes, solos, selects and cues use
the fixed low channel numbers and the `9`-to-`24` families for channels above
the first bank.

| Path family | Function | Scale |
|---|---|---|
| `/1/volumeN` | Fader or output volume | `Fader` |
| `/1/mastervolume` | Main Out volume | `Fader` |
| `/1/panN` | Input/playback send pan or output balance | `Lin01` |
| `/1/mute/1/N` | Channel mute | `OnOff` |
| `/1/solo/1/N` | Solo/PFL | `OnOff` |
| `/1/select/1/N` | Ad-hoc fader group selection | `OnOff` |
| `/1/cue/1/N` | Cue output | `OnOff` |
| `/1/levelNLeft`, `/1/levelNRight` | Meter level | `Level` |
| `/1/tracknameN` | Channel name | `String` |
| `/1/micgainN` | Input preamp gain | `Lin01` |
| `/1/phantom/1/N` | 48 V | `OnOff` |
| `/1/labelSubmix` | Selected submix name | `String` |

Page-1 bus and monitoring controls:

| Path | Function | Scale |
|---|---|---|
| `/1/busInput` | Show input bus data | `Toggle` |
| `/1/busPlayback` | Show playback bus data | `Toggle` |
| `/1/busOutput` | Show output bus data | `Toggle` |
| `/1/globalMute` | Global mute | `Toggle` |
| `/1/globalSolo` | Global solo | `Toggle` |
| `/1/trim` | Trim mode | `Toggle` |
| `/1/mainDim` | DIM | `Toggle` |
| `/1/mainRecall` | Recall Main Out volume | `Toggle` |
| `/1/mainSpeakerB` | Speaker B | `Toggle` |
| `/1/speakerBLinked` | Speaker B linked to Main | `Toggle` |
| `/1/mainMuteFx` | Mute FX return on Main Out | `Toggle` |
| `/1/mainMono` | Mono Main Out | `Toggle` |
| `/1/mainExtIn` | External input path | `Toggle` |
| `/1/mainTalkback` | Talkback | `Toggle`; a non-zero value flips the state, `0.0` is ignored |

Snapshot, group and recorder controls are page 3 only; see section 8.

Channels above the first bank use the range forms
`/1/Level9Left-level24Left`, `/1/Level9Right-level24Right`,
`/1/Trackname9-24` and `/1/micgain9-micgain24`. They carry the same scales
as the single-channel forms; the official table gives them the channel
offset range 8–47.

## 7. Page 2 — selected channel

Page 2 controls the channel selected by the bank/offset commands. The same
path changes meaning with the channel row: input preamp controls apply to
hardware inputs, EQ and dynamics apply to inputs and outputs, and FX send
applies to inputs and software playback.

Page 2 also accepts the bus toggles (`/2/busInput`, `/2/busPlayback`,
`/2/busOutput`), `/2/track+`, `/2/track-`, `/2/labelSubmix`, `/2/trackname`
and the meter paths `/2/levelLeft` and `/2/levelRight`, with the page-1
scales.

| `/2/lowcutEnable` | Low cut enable | `Toggle` | inputs, outputs |
| `/2/lowcutFreq` | Low cut corner | `Freq` | inputs, outputs |

| `/2/trackname` | Channel name | `String` | all |
| `/2/levelLeft`, `/2/levelRight` | Meter level | `Level` | all |

On a linked input pair, a gain command addressed to the left channel also
moves the right preamp by the same step. `/2/gainRight` remains the
independent right-side address. On an unlinked pair each side moves alone.

### 7.1 Toggle commands

`mute`, `solo`, `phase`, `phaseRight`, `phantom`, `instrument`, `pad`,
`autoset`, `msProc`, `stereo`, `lowcutEnable`, `eqEnable`, `compexpEnable`,
`alevEnable`, `loopback`, `cue` and `talkbackSel` are toggles. Send `1.0` to
change the state. `0.0` is not an off command.

`loopback` and `talkbackSel` are per output channel. A linked pair writes
both sides and uses the left side as the pair value; a split pair addresses
each side independently.

`phantom` also accepts `0.0` as a direct off command on the UCX.

### 7.2 EQ band types

Band type choices are spaced evenly over `Lin01` and depend on the device.
Band 1 can select Bell, Low Shelf, High Pass and optionally Low Pass.  Band 3
can select Bell, High Shelf, Low Pass and optionally High Pass.  The UCX
exposes Bell and Low Shelf on band 1, and Bell, High Shelf and Low Pass on
band 3.

### 7.3 Stereo button

`/2/stereo` toggles the pair. A linked pair writes the stereo-mode register on
both sides. Splitting writes the mono value on both sides.

There is no separate link register. The link state is the stereo-mode value.

## 8. Page 3 — FX, snapshots and groups

Page 3 also accepts `/3/globalMute` and `/3/globalSolo`, with the page-1
`Toggle` scale.

| Path | Function | Scale |
|---|---|---|
| `/3/reverbEnable` | Reverb enable | `Toggle` |
| `/3/reverbType` | Reverb type | `Lin01` |
| `/3/reverbPredelay` | Pre-delay | `Lin01` |
| `/3/reverbLowcut` | Low cut | `Freq` |
| `/3/reverbHighcut` | High cut | `Freq` |
| `/3/reverbRoomscale` | Room scale | `Lin01` |
| `/3/reverbAttack` | Envelope attack | `Lin01` |
| `/3/reverbHold` | Envelope hold | `Lin01` |
| `/3/reverbRelease` | Envelope release | `Lin01` |
| `/3/reverbTime` | Space reverb time | `Lin01` |
| `/3/reverbHighdamp` | Space high damp | `Freq` |
| `/3/reverbSmooth` | Smoothness | `Lin01` |
| `/3/reverbWidth` | Stereo width | `Lin01` |
| `/3/reverbVolume` | Reverb volume | `Lin01` |
| `/3/echoEnable` | Echo enable | `Toggle` |
| `/3/echoType` | Echo type | `Lin01` |
| `/3/echoDelaytime` | Delay time | `Lin01` |
| `/3/echoFeedback` | Feedback | `Lin01` |
| `/3/echoWidth` | Stereo width | `Lin01` |
| `/3/echoVolume` | Echo volume | `Lin01` |
| `/3/undo` | Undo | none |
| `/3/redo` | Redo | none |

Snapshot and group paths:

```text
/3/snapshots/8/1 … /3/snapshots/1/1
/3/muteGroups/4/1 … /3/muteGroups/1/1
/3/soloGroups/4/1 … /3/soloGroups/1/1
/3/faderGroups/4/1 … /3/faderGroups/1/1
```

The snapshot number and group number are encoded in the path. Send `1.0` to
load or enable.

Recorder paths:

| Path | Function | Scale |
|---|---|---|
| `/3/recordRecordStart` | Start recording | `Toggle` |
| `/3/recordPlayPause` | Play/pause | `Toggle` |
| `/3/recordStop` | Stop | `Toggle` |
| `/3/recordTime` | Current time | `String` |
| `/3/recordState` | Recorder state | `String` |

## 9. Page 4 — Room EQ

Selecting page 4 selects the output bus. `/4/track+` and `/4/track-` move the
selected output channel; page 2 then edits that output. Room EQ is a TotalMix
FX host feature; it has no UCX register mapping.

| Path | Function | Scale |
|---|---|---|
| `/4/leftChannel` | Select left channel | `Toggle` |
| `/4/rightChannel` | Select right channel | `Toggle` |
| `/4/reqEnable` | Room EQ enable | `Toggle` |
| `/4/reqDelay` | Delay | `Lin01` |
| `/4/reqVolumeCorr` | Volume correction | `Lin01` |
| `/4/reqTypeN` | Band N type | `Lin01` |
| `/4/reqGainN` | Band N gain | `Lin01` |
| `/4/reqFreqN` | Band N frequency | `Freq` |
| `/4/reqQN` | Band N Q | `Lin01` |
| `/4/trackname` | Channel name | `String` |

`N` is 1 through 9. When both `leftChannel` and `rightChannel` are active the
left channel's values are displayed and sent to both sides.

## 10. Feedback

Feedback uses the same paths as control. A value message may be accompanied by
a `Val` message:

```text
/1/micgain1 ,f 0.8
/1/micgain1Val ,s "52.0 dB"
```

| Companion | Contents |
|---|---|
| `volumeVal` | dB or `-oo` |
| `panVal` | pan string |
| `eqTypeNVal` | type name |
| `lowcutGradeVal` | slope name |
| `recordState` | recorder state string |
| `trackname` | channel name |

Feedback is event-driven. Selecting a new page sends the complete state of
that page. Bundles may contain several paths in one datagram; the controller
must not assume one message per datagram or a fixed ordering.

Peak-level feedback is optional. When enabled, TotalMix FX sends the level
paths for the visible channels:

```text
/1/level1Left, /1/level1Right, ...
/2/levelLeft, /2/levelRight
```

The level paths use the `Level` scale. Peak hold keeps the displayed maximum
at each path. These messages are feedback only; they have no control
direction and do not change any UCX register.

## 11. Channel rows and link rules

The three rows are hardware inputs, software playback and hardware outputs.
Page-2 settings apply to the selected row.

### 11.1 Input pairs

Linking an input pair writes `NN02 = 1` to both sides. The left channel is
the reference for the shared controls.

| Parameter | On link | On split |
|---|---|---|
| Volume | Pair level is the louder channel; both keep their difference | Both channel volumes remain |
| Pan | Pan values are retained; linked control is a balance derived from the two volumes | Left and right pans are written hard left and hard right |
| Mute, solo | Left value copied to right | Per-channel |
| 48 V, Inst, Level, refLevel, AutoSet | Left value copied to right | Per-channel |
| Gain | Left value is the linked control; right value retained | Per-channel |
| FX send | Left value copied to right | Per-channel |
| Low cut, EQ, dynamics, AutoLevel | Left values copied to right | Per-channel |
| Phase L, phase R | Independent | Independent |

### 11.2 Playback pairs

Playback pairs use a host-side link. No stereo register is written. Volume,
pan and balance follow the same pair rule as inputs; mute and solo copy from
left to right when linking. Splitting writes hard-left and hard-right pans.
The playback FX send remains per-channel; linking rewrites the pair matrix
without copying the left send value. Width and MS processing remain
host-side pair controls.

### 11.3 Output pairs

Linking an output pair writes `NN04 = 1` to both sides. Volume and balance
are encoded by the two channel volumes; the linked fader shows the pair level
and the balance knob attenuates the quieter side. Mute copies from left to
right. FX return, low cut, EQ, dynamics and AutoLevel copy from left to right
when linking. Phase L and phase R remain independent. Splitting leaves the
two channel volumes and pans available as separate controls.

The output reference level is a line-output group control, not a per-pair
link value. Writing `NN08` on one line output updates the line-output group
registers `0x1208..0x1708` together.

## 12. UCX register mapping

The following table maps OSC controls to UCX IF1 words. `NN` is the channel
register base:

```text
input channel   NN = channel << 8             channel 0..17
output channel  NN = (0x12 + channel) << 8    channel 0..17
right side      + 0x100
```

Inputs use `0x00..0x11`; outputs use `0x12..0x23`. Register values are 16-bit
unless stated otherwise. `0x8000` in the address field is the odd-parity bit,
not part of the address.

Page-1 and page-2 fader values are normalized `0.0 .. 1.0`, using RME's
documented fader curve, not a direct dB value:

```text
position = value * 1023
if position >= 649:
    dB = position * 0.0320855615 - 26.8235294118
else:
    dB = position^2 * (-1/11033) + position * 0.1497326203 - 65.0
```

The resulting dB is converted to the UCX fader-record tenths field. Sending
a fader value is therefore not the same as sending a matrix coefficient or a
literal dB value. The authoritative RME OSC table is
`osc_table_totalmix_new.zip` from the RME downloads page.

| `/3/echoVolume` | `0x3c25` | 0.1 dB, signed |

Snapshot, group, recorder, undo and redo operate on TotalMix FX state and do
not write UCX registers.

### 12.4 Fader and matrix records

Input and playback faders are sends into the selected hardware output:

```text
base = (0x12 + dsp_output) << 8 | (0xe0 + input)
level = tenths_db << 4
pan = (pan << 4) | 8
```

The level and pan are two writes to the same address. The base is
submix-dependent; the selected hardware output chooses the `0x12e0` or
`0x22e0` family.

Matrix cells are:

```text
0x4000 + dsp_output * 0x40 + source
```

`source` is 0..17 for hardware inputs and `0x20..0x31` for software playback.
The value is 15-bit signed with a coarse-scale flag in bit 15.

Playback sends use the `0x4020` and `0x41A0` families, which are different
output rows (`0x4020` is AN 1/2 and `0x41A0` is Phones), not copies of one
another. The playback FX send uses `0x47a0 + channel` and its `+0x40`
mirror.

Each side of an output pair has its own fader record. The selected submix
does not imply the other side; both must be written when a pair is restored.

### 12.5 IF1 word

Each IF1 word is a 32-bit little-endian value:

```text
bits 31      bits 30..16      bits 15..0
parity       address:15       value:16
```

The parity bit is odd parity over the address and value. Words are coalesced
into bursts; a burst carries complete 4-byte words. A 4-byte word is
`[value16 LE][address16 LE]` after stripping the parity bit.

The UCX state stream on endpoint `0x8d` uses the same word layout.

## 13. Global OSC

Global OSC is the absolute-channel dialect of TotalMix FX 2.1 and later.  It
has no bank, page, track or submix selection state: every input, playback and
output is addressed by its absolute position, and values use native units.

### 13.1 Transport and values

Global OSC uses the same UDP transport and OSC 1.0 encoding as
[§1](#1-transport).  A command carries one value argument unless the path is
listed as a trigger.

- Float and double values are accepted interchangeably.
- An integer is accepted where a float is expected.
- A boolean is true for a non-zero integer or a float greater than or equal
  to `0.5`; a false value is zero.
- A trigger fires for a bare message or for a value greater than or equal to
  `0.5`; a value below `0.5` is ignored.
- Channel positions are zero-based.  Snapshot numbers, layout numbers and
  group numbers are one-based.

### 13.2 Address spaces

| Path | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `/input/{channel}/{field}` | Hardware input strip |
| `/playback/{channel}/{field}` | Software playback strip |
| `/output/{channel}/{field}` | Hardware output strip |
| `/mix/{in\|pb}/{channel}/{submix}/{field}` | Matrix send from an input or playback channel into an output submix |
| `/controlroom/{field}` | Monitor section |
| `/reverb/{field}`, `/echo/{field}` | FX returns |
| `/durec/{field}` | Recorder transport and status |
| `/mutegroup/{n}`, `/sologroup/{n}`, `/fadergroup/{n}` | Channel groups `1..4` |
| `/globalmute`, `/globalsolo`, `/undo`, `/redo` | Global actions |
| `/snapshot/...`, `/layout/load/{n}`, `/showwindow` | Snapshot, layout and window actions |
| `/send...` | Feedback and state-dump requests |
| `/level/{in\|pb\|out}/{channel}` | Meter level feedback |
| `/status/{device\|connection\|dsp}` | Connection and DSP status feedback |

`/mix` addresses a source channel against one output submix.  `submix` is the
zero-based hardware output channel; input and playback rows are the only
matrix sources.

### 13.3 Channel fields

The codec accepts a common field set; the application exposes only fields the
current device and channel type support.

| Field | Value | Channel type |
|---|---|---|
| `mute` | Boolean | all |
| `stereo` | Boolean | all |
| `record` | Boolean | input, playback |
| `name` | String | all |
| `playchan` | Index | playback |
| `msproc` | Boolean | all |
| `phase` | Boolean | all |
| `width` | Number | all |
| `pfl` | Boolean | input |
| `gain` | dB | input |
| `reflevel` | Index | input, output |
| `48v` | Boolean | input |
| `instrument` | Boolean | input |
| `pad` | Boolean | input |
| `autoset` | Boolean | input |
| `volume` | dB | playback, output |
| `faderlin` | `0.0..1.0` | playback, output |
| `balpan` | `-100..100` | playback, output |
| `fxsend` | dB | input, playback |
| `fxreturn` | dB | output |
| `crossfeed` | dB | output |
| `loopback` | Boolean | output |
| `talkbacksel` | Boolean | output |
| `delay` | ms | output |
| `color` | Index | output |
| `lowcut/{field}` | Low-cut controls | input, playback, output |
| `eq/band{n}{gain\|freq\|q\|type}` | EQ band controls | input, playback, output |
| `dynamics/{field}` | Dynamics controls | input, playback, output |
| `autolevel/{field}` | Auto Level controls | input, playback, output |
| `roomeq/{field}` | Room EQ controls | output |

The EQ, dynamics, Auto Level and Room EQ subfields use the field names of the
Global OSC reference table.  A device without the corresponding DSP does not
expose those paths.

### 13.4 Matrix fields

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `fader` | dB |
| `faderlin` | `0.0..1.0` |
| `balpan` | `-100..100` |
| `solo` | Boolean |
| `groupflags` | Integer bit mask |

A matrix write addresses one source and one output submix.  The application
writes the source's send level and pan for that submix.

### 13.5 Control Room

| Path | Value |
|---|---|
| `/controlroom/mainout` | Zero-based output channel |
| `/controlroom/mainoutb` | Zero-based output channel |
| `/controlroom/phones1` … `phones4` | Zero-based output channel |
| `/controlroom/mainmono` | Boolean |
| `/controlroom/dimreduction` | dB |
| `/controlroom/dim` | Boolean |
| `/controlroom/recallvolume` | dB |
| `/controlroom/recall` | Trigger |
| `/controlroom/talkchannel` | Zero-based input channel |
| `/controlroom/talkback` | Boolean |
| `/controlroom/cuechan` | Zero-based output channel; `-1` clears Cue |
| `/controlroom/externalin` | Boolean |
| `/controlroom/extinchannel` | Zero-based input channel |
| `/controlroom/extingain` | dB |
| `/controlroom/linkab` | Boolean |
| `/controlroom/speakerb` | Boolean |
| `/controlroom/mutefx` | Boolean |

### 13.6 Global actions

| Path | Value |
|---|---|
| `/mutegroup/{1..4}`, `/sologroup/{1..4}`, `/fadergroup/{1..4}` | Boolean |
| `/globalmute`, `/globalsolo` | Boolean |
| `/undo`, `/redo` | Trigger |
| `/snapshot/load/{n}` | Trigger; the optional argument is the snapshot state |
| `/snapshot/save` | Trigger |
| `/layout/load/{n}` | Trigger |
| `/reverb/{field}`, `/echo/{field}` | FX controls |
| `/durec/{play\|pause\|stop\|record\|next\|previous}` | Trigger |
| `/durec/{time\|state}` | String feedback |
| `/showwindow` | Boolean |

### 13.7 Feedback and state requests

Global OSC feedback is event-driven.  The surface sends state after a change
and supports the following dump requests:

| Path | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `/sendstate` | Full state |
| `/sendchan/{in\|pb\|out}/{channel}` | One channel strip |
| `/sendmix/{mode}` | Matrix state; mode `1` or `2` |
| `/sendsubmix/{n}` | One output submix; optional mode `1` or `2` |
| `/sendsettings` | Device settings |
| `/sendall/{mode}` | Complete state; mode `1` or `2` |

Feedback uses the same paths and native values as control.  Meter levels are
sent as `/level/{in\|pb\|out}/{channel}` with dB values; connection and DSP
state use `/status/connection`, `/status/device` and `/status/dsp`.

A state dump is a sequence of ordinary OSC messages or bundles.  The receiver
does not need to acknowledge a dump and does not use the bank/page state of
OSC 1.96.

### 13.8 Cue

Global OSC carries Cue in the Control Room namespace:

```text
/controlroom/cuechan N
```

`N` is the zero-based hardware output channel whose submix is cued;
`-1` clears Cue. It is the cued output, not the Cue/PFL monitoring target.
The target remains a TotalMix setting (`Assign → Cue/PFL to`).

Cue replaces the target submix with the cued output's fader and matrix
records, sets the target FX returns to `-65.0 dB`, and writes the monitor
mask. Releasing Cue restores the target from the model and returns
`0x3f98` to its idle value.

## 14. UC surface support

The UC accepts both OSC dialects, but only part of the surface is backed by
UC device writes.  This table records the observed UC capability; a path not
listed as device-backed is host-side state or unsupported on the UC.

| Family | UC behaviour |
|---|---|
| Input gain | Device-backed: `0x1a` (1 dB on inputs 1/2, half-dB on 3/4) |
| 48 V | Device-backed through page-2 `phantom`; page-1 phantom is OnOff |
| Instrument | Device-backed through page-2 `instrument` |
| PAD | Host-side/UI-only; no OSC device write observed |
| Input mute, solo, stereo, width, MS, PFL, FX send | Host-side |
| Matrix fader and balance | Device-backed: `0x12` |
| Matrix solo and group flags | Host-side |
| Output fader | Device-backed: `0x1a` and `0x12` masters |
| Output volume and balance paths | Host-side |
| Output loopback | Device-backed: `0x15` |
| Output FX return, crossfeed, delay, reference, talkback select | Host-side |
| Control Room main mono | Device-backed |
| Other Control Room controls | Host-side |
| Global mute/solo, undo/redo, groups | Host-side |
| Snapshot load | Device-backed scene write |
| Snapshot save, layout load | Host-side |
| EQ, low cut, dynamics, Auto Level, Room EQ | Not available through the UC OSC surface |
| Reverb, echo, DURec | Not available through the UC OSC surface |

Phase is a special case: classic page-2 `/2/phase` produced no UC device
write, while the TotalMix UI phase control writes request `0x18`.  Do not
describe OSC phase as a UC device-backed control.

The UC manual specifies a Peak and RMS meter for every input, playback and
hardware output, calculated in the device hardware.  The UC manual specifies hardware Peak/RMS meters.  The `0x85` stream carries
them: words `w91`/`w93` and `w139`/`w141` are left/right meter pairs, and they
scale monotonically with a -6/-20/-40/-60 dBFS test tone.  The full channel
stride and section order remain to be mapped; TotalControl currently still
uses the host audio path.  TotalControl currently feeds UC meters from the host audio
path and does not start the UC `0x85`/`0x8d` streams; that is an implementation
gap, not evidence that the device lacks meters.  The `0x8b` endpoint carries
no status payload in the captured connects.
