//! (the mark + wordmark, see `app::top_bar`), it draws as a centered modal
//! above the whole window (see `about_modal`) rather than the docked drawer
//! it used to be: that drawer was pushed after the page content, so on the
//! Quick view it landed below the fold and on the Mixer view it came after
//! every strip row.
